# Vite Starter Template

Sets up a very minimal Vite project with all my favorite tools and configurations.

## 🤔 How to Use?

Click the `Use this template` button to create a new repository with the same directory structure and files.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Vite w/ React
- ✅ TypeScript (with custom import path alias)
- ✅ React Router (for routing and navigation)
- ✅ Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Tailwind Prettier Plugin (for auto sorting class names)
- ✅ ESLint + Prettier (for code formatting and linting)

## 🚀 Getting Started

_Prerequisites: You will need [Node.js (LTS recommended)](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine._

1. Clone the template

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aryanprince/vite-starter.git
```

2. Install dependencies (using your favourite package manager)

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

3. Start dev server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
5. Start building your app!

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Install your favourite components library (like [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [Radix Themes](https://www.radix-ui.com/), or [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/))
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/) is the best way to handle data fetching
- Use [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for creating custom forms
- Setup your favourite state management library (like [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) or [Jotai](https://jotai.org/))

## 📦 Project Structure

```bash
├── public
├── src

│   │   └── home.tsx (home page)
│   ├── styles
│   │   └── index.css
│   ├── main.tsx (entry point)
```

## 📝 Todo
